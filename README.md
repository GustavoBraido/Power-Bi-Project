### [Data Source](InformationIsBeautiful.net)

Data: Title, genre, studio, profitability, and ratings for movies released between 2007 and 2012.

Using a data collection that I previously cleaned in **RStudio**, I generated a dashboard with the following parameters:

1- Sum of Rotten Tomatoes by Genre

2- Sum of Profitability by Lead Studio

3- Count of Film by Year

4- Sum of Audience Score by Film
